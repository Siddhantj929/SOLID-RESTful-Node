# Target

-   Separation of Concerns
-   Scalable Interfaces

# Setup

-   ~~Create a one-page API that will handle the CRUD operations for a user AND user's story.~~

# Pathway

After building the one-page api now it is time to refactor it to make it scalable and SOLID accomplice.

-   ~~Create a "database" module that will handle all things related to the actual database and separate the database concerns by using this module~~

-   ~~Create a user "model" that will be responsible for conversing database directly~~

-   Create a stories "model" that may need to use the User's model to check and update User's data.
